####Â Description
The main purpose of the application to develop is to provide a HTTP endpoint to query the different events. This endpoint should accept a "start_date" and a "end_date" param, and return only the events within this time range.
- We should only receive the available events (the sell mode is online, the rest should be ignored)
- We should be able to request to this endpoint events from the past (since we have the app
running) and the future.

Considerations:
- The external company provides us an API in a remote server, let's assume the file is served on

# Runing the API:

There is a `start.sh`script in the root folder. In order to start it, you will need be connected to the internet and docker-compose installed. Then, execute the script as ` ./start.sh`.
If you have any problems during the installation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

# Solution description

- I have developed an api that can be queried to get all the events in a range of dates. In order to do so, I have considered to main components:
	- Event loader: The component is a job that it is executed each 24 hours and at the start of the API. This job reads the xml and loads all the information in a relational database (postgres)
	- Api: It serves an index endpoint under `events`router to query the different events between specific dates. An example of a request would be the following: 
	- `http://localhost:4000/api/events?start_date=2019-07-30T20:00:00&end_date=2019-07-31T20:00:00`

- The main idea under this solution it is to separate the querying and loading information processes, as the information source changes periodically. Thus, the querying will be much faster under a served database rather than over the source of the information.

# Development

- The application has been developed in elixir under the framework phoenix. Elixir provides excelent resources, not only for web development, but also for executing fast, independent and asynchronous processes.
- Under the API whe can find several folders that contains the source code of the application:
 - `lib`: Application code. It contains all the information related to the entities, and controllers of the app.
 - `test`: Unitary tests.
 - `priv/migrations`: Migrations composing the relational model of the database.

# Final Considerations:

- The xml model has been transformed to a relational one as is. There are several base events, containing one event, each of them having several zones. Any changes on this format could make the app to fail as I don't have any further information to create a more robust solution.
- The ids of the base events are unique, but those of the events and zones, there aren't as we can see different entities having the same ids.
- Querying dates must have standard formats, eg: `2019-07-30T20:00:00`.

# Improvements:

- As I have focused most of my time to develop separate components to loading and querying purposes, I have left aside some important features that would improve the functioning of the application dramatically:
	- Better analysis of the xml model an its transalte to the app's model
	- Best error management
	- More covering of the code by unitary tests.
  - Xml url is hardcoded on events loader. It should be provided by an external variable.
  - Events loading period of 24h hours is hardcoded. It should be configurable.

# Alternative Running:

# EventManager

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
